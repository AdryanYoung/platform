The CASH Music platform gives all musicians access to tools that let them manage, 
promote, and sell their music online â€” all owned and controlled themselves.

The whole thing is designed to work as a freestanding API or integrated with
publishing and CMS systems like Wordpress or Drupal. The standard repo contains the core 
framework, installers, an admin webapp, APIs, demos, and a full suite of tests.
