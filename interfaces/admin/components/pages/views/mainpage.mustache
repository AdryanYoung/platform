		You can edit your <a class="settings toggle">account settings</a>, including important stuff like your password &amp; homepage info, at any time by clicking on the <!--<a class="settings hlt">gear icon</a>--> gear icon in the upper right hand menu. 
		</p><p>
		The platform works with your own storage, payment, and mailing list accounts. To add connections to your services, open the <a class="settings toggle">settings menu</a>, click "Connections," and choose the type of account you'd like to connect. 
		</p><p>
		Next it’s time to <a class="lightboxed" href="{{www_path}}/campaigns/add/">add a campaign</a>. Campaigns are there to help you organize your digital workflow. You can add or edit elements here as well as keep track of how they are doing. A campaign can be easily published as one single page on our hosted site.

		Now that you've set up a campaign, it's time to <a class="lightboxed store" href="{{www_path}}/elements/add/">add some elements</a>. Elements are the tools you’ll be using in your campaign, like email collection and digital sales. Every individual element can be embedded on any site by simple copy/paste or you can add several elements to a campaign and publish it as a single page. 
		</p><p>
		Don't worry; nobody else will see anything until you publish it, and you can always edit any element even after you've published a campaign

		You’ve probably noticed things look a little different in here but it’s easy to get it all ship shape. First, check out your <a class="settings toggle">account settings</a> and make sure your connections are in order by clicking on the gear icon in the upper right hand menu. 
		</p><p>
		You’ll find all of your old elements in a campaign of their own called Archive. Campaigns are here to help you organize your elements, keep track of how they’re doing, and easily publish them on one page if you like (you can still embed as many elements as you like on external sites).
