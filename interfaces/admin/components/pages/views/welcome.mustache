	<h1>Hello! Welcome to the new version of the CASH platform. Thanks for signing up!</h1>

		The platform works with your own storage, payment, and mailing list accounts. To add connections to your services, open the <a class="settings toggle">settings menu</a>, click "Connections," and choose the type of account you'd like to connect.

		Next itâ€™s time to <a class="lightboxed" href="{{www_path}}/campaigns/add/">add a campaign</a>. Campaigns are there to help you organize your digital workflow. You can add or edit elements here as well as keep track of how they are doing. A campaign can be easily published as one single page on our hosted site.
