	<h5>TL;DR</h5>
	<p class="big">The short version is that we built this thing to help you take control of how you release your music. Use your own accounts. Do it your way. Try new things and get them to your audience quickly.</p>
	<p>All the rest is just details. On the main page you can create a campaign and fill it with all the elements you need to make it work for you. Embed those elements on your own website or publish them on a page here. It's up to you.</p>
	<p>All free, now and forever.</p>
