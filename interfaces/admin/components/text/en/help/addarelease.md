###Add a release or file

What you'll need:

- A storage connection, we recommend Amazon S3

To add a release or file, navigate into **Assets** from the left-hand menu. 

If this is your first time adding an asset and you haven't already added a storage connection, you'll be prompted to add those connections. If you host your own files, you'll find links at the bottom of the page to **Add a file** or **Add a new release**.

**Adding a new release**

If you choose to add a new release, you'll be prompted to give it a name and a description—this is for your reference only. When you're done, click **Add that asset**. You'll be brought to your newly-created release page, where you can specify the artist name, release date, and catalog number, and begin attaching files.

To get started, click **Attach A File**. You'll once again be prompted to provide an internal name and description, and then asked which storage connection to use. If you've set up a Drive or S3 account, select it from the **Which storage connection?** dropdown menu and an upload button will appear. If you host the files on your own server, provide the location (URI). When you're done, click **Add that asset**. To return to your release and continue adding files, click the arrow in the upper-left-hand corner.

When you're done adding files to your release, click **Save changes**.

**Tip**: All the files you attach to a given release will be made available as a group. For instance, if you're offering an album and attach 12 mp3 files and two artwork files, whoever accesses your release through one of our elements will have to individually download all fourteen files. Consider compressing all your files into a zip file.

**Uploading a file**

If you choose to add a file, you'll be prompted to give it a name and a description—this is for your reference only. If you've set up a Drive or S3 account, select it from the **Which storage connection?** dropdown menu and an upload button will appear to add your file. If you host the files on your own server, provide the location (URI). When you're done, click **Add that asset**.
