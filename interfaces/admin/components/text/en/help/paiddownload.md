###Sell a digital download

Paid digital downloads using your own S3 and payment accounts. A simple and efficient way to sell music directly from your site.

What you'll need:  

- A storage connection, we recommend an Amazon S3 account for reliability 
- A file or release asset with fulfillment files attached 
- A payment connection

Once you've set up your asset head over to the Commerce section. Click on **Inventory** in the Commerce sub menu, then click **Add an Item**. This is where youâ€™ll give it a **public** title and description, set the price, and enable "pay-at-least" pricing if you like. You'll also need to connect the fufillment file that you wish to sell. If you've already set it up as an asset it will be in your dropdown menu here, simply select the file and hit **save changes**. 

If this is the only thing you wish to sell it's time to create a **Single Purchase** element. Head back over to the main page, select the **elements** tab and click **add an element**. Select **Single Purchase**. Choose the item you wish to sell from the dropdown men and give it a name for your own reference. To edit the success/error message click on the **Element settings** button and tweak until your heart's content. 

Once the element is created either embed it on your site or on your CASH Music page and hit publish. 
When a customer buys your music they'll go off-site to Paypal for the transaction and return to a confirmation page with download options.  

All completed orders will show up in your **Commerce** section. You can also find details on every order, manage inventory, and export orders at any time there.
