### Why Amazon S3?

An **[Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/)** connection is used to store and access files for assets. It 
offers a high level of security and reliability, while off-loading bandwidth that could swamp a smaller 
web host accounts. This means your website won't slow down, even if you're offering big files to a large audience.

### Step by step

To set up a connection to S3 you first need to sign up for an Amazon Web Services account at 
[aws.amazon.com](http://aws.amazon.com/). After that you're just a few quick steps away from setting 
everything up. 

 1. Log in and select "Security Credentials" from the upper right-hand menu. You'll see a prompt that asks if you want to continue to security credentials or get started with IAM Users. Select "Continue to Security Credentials".
 2. Create a new access key, and mark down both the Access Key ID and the Secret Access Key. You'll need both, and to keep your files secure, Amazon will not let you retrieve the information later. You'll also be able to download your key file with this information to keep on your computer.
 3. Now you need to set up a "bucket" which is like an online folder for file storage. Go to the 
    Services menu at the top of the page, and select "AWS Management Console" from under My Account/Console. This will open your management console.
 4. Next, select "S3" from the listed services.
 5. You'll see a "Create Bucket" button. Create a bucket, give it a name
    with all lower-case letters and no spaces. Copy this exactly. 
 6. Now back in your CASH admin panel, open System Settings > Connections and add a new S3 connection. Give it a
    name, add the key, secret, and bucket you copied from Amazon, and the connection will be available 
    in the platform. 

All done.
