###Add a payment connection


Connecting your CASH Music account to your PayPal and/or Stripe accounts makes it possible for you to sell both digital and physical merchandise. It's easy and both only require a few quick steps.

Select the **gear icon** <i class="icon icon-cog"></i> from the upper-right-hand corner to open up your account settings. Click the **Connections** button. 

To set up PayPal select the **PayPal** button. You'll be prompted for your PayPal business account email address. Once you're entered it, click **Add The Connection**, and you're all set! 

To add Stripe simply select the **Stripe** button under Connections. If you do not yet have a Stripe account you can set one up as you make the connection. Stripe allows you to take credit cards on your site directly.
