###Selling a physical item

What you'll need:

- A payment connection 

To get started, head over to the **Commerce** section. Next, select **Inventory** from the sub menu. Click **Add an item**, and you'll be prompted to give a public name and description for the item as well as price, quantity, and whether or not there's a digital fulfillment file. Be sure to check the **Physical goods?** box, and then save your changes.

Once the inventory item has been saved there will be a physical options section below it. This is where you'll choose your shipping prices for both regions as well as add/edit options such as color, size, etc for merchandise.

After you've added your item(s) head back to the main page, click on the **Elements** tab and then either select a **Single Purchase** element or the **Store** element, depending on what you need. 

Once the element is created and you're ready to go live, either embed it on your site or on your CASH Music page and publish. 

If you included a digital fulfillment file with the purchase of your physical product, the confirmation page your customer sees will include download options. They will also receive an email receipt with a link to download as well. 

All orders will show up in your **Commerce** section. You can also find details on every order, manage inventory, and export orders at any time there.
