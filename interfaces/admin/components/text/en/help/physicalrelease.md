Before you get started:

- [Have you set up a PayPal connection?] (http://cashmusic.org/admin/help/paypal)
- If you plan to offer a digital download with the purchase of your physical product, [have you added your files or release yet] (http://cashmusic.org/admin/help/addarelease)? 

To get started, select **Commerce** from the left-hand menu to open the commerce overview page, and click the **Commerce Settings** link at the bottom of the page. Select which currency you'd like to use, and then click **Use this currency**.

Next, select **Inventory** from the left-hand menu. Click **Add an item**, and you'll be prompted to give a public name for the item, a private description, and to specify the price, quantity, and whether there's a digital fulfillment file.

Be sure to check the **Physical goods?** box, and then save your changes.

Now go to your campaign and create a **Single Purchase** element. Give it a name for your own reference. Now select the item and Paypal connection you'd like to use. Tweak messages until your heart's content.

Once the element is created and you're ready to go live, either embed it or publish the campaign page. 

When a customer buys your music, they'll go off-site to PayPal for the transaction and return to a confirmation page. If you included a digital fulfillment file with the purchase of your physical product, the confirmation page will include download options, and the customer will also receive a one-time use code to unlock the download just in case they're on their phone or tablet. 

All completed orders will show up in your **Commerce** section. You can also find details on every order, manage inventory, and export orders at any time there.
