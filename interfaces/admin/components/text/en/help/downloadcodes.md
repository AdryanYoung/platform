Every file or release asset can be associated with download codes. So first you'll need to add an S3
connection and upload some files â€” either direct as files or to a release under it's "fulfillment files" 
section. 

You'll need:  

 - An S3 connection to upload files
 - A file or release asset with fulfillment files attached

Once you have an asset you want to add codes to just go to it's edit screen. Click on the Asset settings wrench icon below the asset details. Type in how many download codes you'd like and hit add codes to generate them. This is also where you can export your codes to an Excel/Google Docs compatible CSV file. 

Now either start a new campaign or go to an existing one and add a new "Download Codes" element. Give it a name for your own internal reference. It'll work with any code you've generated, and automatically give the correct asset to any valid codes.
