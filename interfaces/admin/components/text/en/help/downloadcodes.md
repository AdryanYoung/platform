Every file or release asset can be associated with download codes. So first you'll need to add an S3
connection and upload some files â€” either direct as files or to a release under it's "fulfillment files" 
section. 

What you'll need:  

 - An S3 connection to upload files
 - A file or release asset with fulfillment files attached

Once you have an asset you want to add codes to just click on the Asset settings below. Type in how many download codes you'd like and hit add codes to generate them. This is also where you can export your codes to an Excel/Google Docs compatible CSV file. 

Now either start a new campaign or go to an existing one and add a new **Download Codes** element. This is where your fans will redeem the codes you give them. Give it a name for your own internal reference and edit the success message. 

 This element will actually work with any code you've generated for any of your assets. It will automatically give the correct asset to any valid codes. 

 Finally, either publish your campaign page or embed the element on your own site.
