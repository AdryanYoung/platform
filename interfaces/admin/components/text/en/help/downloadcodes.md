###Download codes 

What you'll need:  

 - An S3 connection to upload files
 - A file or release asset with fulfillment files attached

Once you have an asset you want to add codes to just click on the **Asset settings** below. Type in how many download codes you'd like and hit add codes to generate them. This is also where you can export your codes to an Excel/Google Docs compatible CSV file. 

Now you'll need to make the redepemtion form so your fans can redeem their codes.. Go back to the main page, click on the **Elements** tab, click on **Add an Element** and choose **Download Codes**. Give it a name for your own internal reference and edit the public success message. 

 Finally, either add the element to your CASH Music page or embed the element on your own site.

 Fun fact: this element will work with any code you've generated for any of your assets. It knows to automatically give the correct asset to any valid codes. So you just have to set it once and forget. Easy.
