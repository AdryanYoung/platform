###Publish a campaign page

What you'll need
- A campaign  

Once you're done setting up your campaign click the **edit icon**  <i class="icon icon-pencil"></i> and select **Page theme**. It'll prompt you to choose a light or dark theme for your page. You change or customize it at any time. 

 Click on the campaign's **edit icon** again to find your page template. It includes an editor and some basic html code. If you're a novice and aren't sure what this code means, don't worry! We've made it really easy. Just look for **div id="mainspace"**. There's an empty line after it. Click there.

You'll see all your campaign's elements are listed to the right of the template. Just click the **+** sign to embed the elements into your campaign. You can also include any custom html or css you'd like. Once you're all done, click **Save changes**.

Now that you're back on your main page, scroll down until you see a box that says **Publish Settings**. Select your campaign from the drop-down menu, and when asked if you're sure about changing your public page, select **Yes, do it**.

If you want to go back and edit your campaign, just scroll back up and edit the page template again. And if you ever want to unpublish your campaign, just scroll back down to **Publish Settings** and select **None** from the dropdown menu.
