###Create and publish a campaign

To create a campaign, navigate to the main page and click the **Add a Campaign** button. Give it a name and a description. Only you'll be able to see thisâ€”it'll help you keep your campaigns organized.

Next, you'll want to begin adding elements to your campaign. Click the **Add +** button to the right. 

Once you're done adding elements, return to the main page. Click the **edit icon**  <i class="icon icon-pencil"></i> and select **Page theme**.

Here, you'll see your campaign template. It includes an editor and some basic html code. If you're a novice and aren't sure what this code means, don't worry! We've made it really easy. Just look for **div id="mainspace"**. There's an empty line after it. Click there.

You'll see all your campaign's elements are listed to the right. Just click the **+** sign to embed the elements into your campaign. You can also include any custom html or css you'd like. Once you're all done, click **Save changes**.

Now that you're back on your main page, scroll down until you see a box that says **Publish Settings**. Select your campaign from the drop-down menu, and when asked if you're sure about changing your public page, select **Yes do it**.

If you want to go back and edit your campaign, just scroll back up and edit the page template again. And if you ever want to unpublish your campaign, just scroll back down to **Publish Settings** and select **None** from the dropdown menu.
