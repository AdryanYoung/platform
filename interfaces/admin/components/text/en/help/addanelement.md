###Embed an element

It's easy to embed any element on your own site. Simply choose the element you'd like to embed and click on the embed icon <i class="icon icon-share"></i> to add it to your clipboard or open up the element and copy the code from there.

Next, go to your site and paste the embed link into the code where you want it to live. That's it. Just like you would, say, a video from YouTube or a song from SoundCloud.   

You can embed as many of your elements as you like, on as many sites as you like.
