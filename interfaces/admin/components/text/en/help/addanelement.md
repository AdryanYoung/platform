It's easy to embed an element on your own site. Simply choose the element you'd like to embed and click on the get link icon to add it to your clipboard or open up the element and copy the code from there.

Next, go to your site and paste the embed link into the code where you want it to live. That's it. Just like you would, say, a YouTube video.  

You can embed as many elements as you like, on as many sites as you like.
