If you already have a tour dates element up when you add more events here you will automatically publish them on your page unless you uncheck the published box. If you’re waiting to announce a show or tour make sure you uncheck published so you don’t spill the beans.</p><p>Cancelled show? Make sure and go into that event’s details and select cancelled. You can make notes in the comments section letting fans know about refunds or rescheduling.</p>",
