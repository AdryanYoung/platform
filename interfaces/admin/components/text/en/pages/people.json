Right now it's a great place to connect or set up your email lists, maintain your contacts database, as well as keep track of press clippings and related links about your band online. All of these things will come in handy esp when you're looking for a new booking agent, label, or biggest fan's email address.</p> <p>It's important to note that whenever you set up an email collection element you'll need to set up and/or connect a list that all those email addresses coming in will be collected to.
