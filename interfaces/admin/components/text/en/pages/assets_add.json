Once you’ve added your release info you can then generate and export download codes. You don’t have to have a fulfillment file up yet to generate them which is handy if you're using them for LP's but make sure you’ve uploaded it, and made a corresponding download code redemption form element, before you start sending those codes out!</p><p>You can always change any details - all linked commerce items and elements will automatically reflect the changes.</p>",
