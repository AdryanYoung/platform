# CASH Music Platform

The CASH Music platform gives everyone access to tools that let them manage, 
promote, and sell their music online â€” all owned and controlled themselves.

The platform can be used as a PHP library, integrated into popular CMS systems, 
or standalone with the included admin app. This repo contains the core framework, 
installers, an admin webapp, APIs, demos, and a full suite of tests.

## Requirements

One of our goals is for this to run in as many places as possible, so we've worked 
hard to keep the requirements minimal:

 * PHP 5.4+
 * PDO (a default) and MySQL OR SQLite 
 * mod_rewrite (for admin app)
 * fopen wrappers OR cURL

## Submitting a pull request

We the 'master' branch release-ready at all times, so we ask all contributors to [TEST](https://github.com/cashmusic/platform/blob/master/tests/README.md) your code before submitting a pull request. Please 
create a descriptively named branch off your repo and give as many details in your pull request as possible.

We view pull requests as conversations. Submit a pull request early if you're working on something and
have questions. We'll work with you to get it where it needs to be for a merge.
